                <h3>about</h3>
                <p>
                    The story of the GTA V game revolves around three main characters in the game, Michael, Franklin and
                    Trevor
                    (Michael-Trevor-Franklin), who are criminals whose stories are related to each other through the
                    tasks that they carry
                    out together in the city of (Los Santos), where inside the game there is a special story for each
                    character. With it,
                    you will discover it yourself, but the story of Michael & Trevor was mixed in the beginning, where
                    the game revolves at
                    the beginning with three characters who were trying to rob a bank, including Michael and Trevor,
                    after they succeeded in
                    robbing the bank and they escaped together in a car that was waiting for them outside with a driver
                    who was killed by
                    the police during the chase to If they ran away from the police for a moment, but the joy was not
                    complete, the car was
                    destroyed, which resulted in them heading to the plane on foot, but there was an unknown person
                    waiting for them, so he
                    sniped their third friend and Michael was also shot by a gunshot, which made Trevor screaming
                    because he was seeing his
                    best friend in his last moments and was intending to try To kill the sniper, but Trevor prevented
                    him from doing that
                    and told him run with your life. We are my death. Trevor could not escape. The police attacked them,
                    and there was a
                    clash between Trevor and the police, which made Trevor take one of the skis. Because the city held
                    him hostage to him,
                    an old woman who ran away and released her, and Trevor was unable to take his share of the stolen
                    money, Michael escaped
                    his injury and faked his death and is now living with his family in the witness protection program,
                    and Trevor
                    disappeared in a remote place outside Los Santos in a barren desert where he did not plant. No
                    water, and this was the
                    story of the characters Michael and Trevor at the beginning of the events of the game
