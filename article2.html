                    been delayed to the fall, which makes a few months in our upcoming PC game calendar look a little
                    bit lean. But it's hardly empty, and you never know when a game like Valheim will come along and
                    become a surprise smash hit.</p>

                        “twice the size” of Warhammer 2’s Eye of the Vortex map.

                        The Warhammer 3 factions of the Chaos gods – Khorne, Tzeentch, Nurgle, and Slaanesh – will all
                        be present, plus Kislev and Grand Cathay as human civilizations, with more to be announced.

                            exploration in this one.

                            The films already covered in the game are being remade, and you can tackle them in any order
                            but, you’ll now be able to explore space just as you did Lego Marvel Superheroes’ Manhattan.
                            What’s more, you can fight and explore the inside of Star Destroyers, each made of 18
                            million digital bricks.</p>

                            <p>SUbisoft’s limited-time PvE mode which ended with 4.5 billion zombies slain – if you
                                check the Rainbow Six Siege Outbreak stats – was just too well-made to be removed for
                                good. Once Rainbow Six Quarantine was revealed at E3 2019, the spiritual sequel to it
                                was official.

                                In the run up to the Rainbow Six Quarantine release date you can look forward to
                                3-player PvE co-op that features operators such as Ela and Vigil tackling the fallout of
                                “an unknown and devastating parasite”. However, the rumoured Rainbow Six Quarantine
                                permadeath features seem to make this a rather different beast from standard Siege.</p>

                                </h2>
                                <p>It’s a meeting of minds only the most optimistic of fantasy RPG fans could conjure
                                    up, but it’s happening. The Elden Ring E3 2019 trailer gives only cryptic clues for
                                    fans to dissect for months to come, but here’s the only thing you need to know: it’s
                                    a FromSoftware open-world game written by George R. R. ‘A Song of Ice and Fire’
                                    Martin.

                                    As you’d expect Elden Ring reflects Dark Souls’ gameplay in terms of difficulty, but
                                    combat, Miyazaki-san says, is “fundamentally different” and its FromSoft’s biggest
                                    game yet. Martin has reportedly penned reams of lore for this dark new universe, and
                                    we couldn’t be more hyped.

                                        turn-based combat and squad management require some strategic thinking, even
                                        from veterans of the genre. The game features over 300 heroes for you to
                                        collect, each with their own stats and unique abilities, meaning you’ll have to
                                        tweak and optimise your squad to make the most of your characters’ strengths.
                                        You can also take the fight online by either teaming up with other players in
                                        co-op, err, raids, or defeating their squad in battle to gain valuable rewards.
